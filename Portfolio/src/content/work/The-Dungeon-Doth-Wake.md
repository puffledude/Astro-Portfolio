## The Dissertation
### What did I make?
For my dissertation, I created a roguelike turn-based tactical JRPG style game, where the enemies would change
depending on the weapons of the party. At the begining of each round, the players party spawns at the bottom of the level. From here
they have to climb their way up to the door at the top. The level layout is randomised each battle so they should never play the exact level twice.

### Why did I make this?
My overall goal was to make a game that adapted to the player, targeting their weaknesses when they're strong and relaxing tension
when they needed time to heal.
At the time I was planning my dissertation, I was playing a few diferent games. Whilst all unique, I felt some of their mechanics might work well together.
Primarily I took from two games, Fire Emblem for the TRPG gameplay (including the weapon triangle) and Left 4 Dead and it's ideas of a director algorithm.
The project would be considered a success if it provided a solid balance of challenging gameplay and occasional mercy.

### How did things go?
Development ultimately took longer than I expected, leading to a large portion of my original plans having to be axed (items and XP).
This hurt the game in that the director could ultimately only adapt in a limited number of ways. Furthermore, when performing my playtest
with other people, it turned out there was a major flaw in my design. Due to how the director adapted player count and how I implemented
the weapon triangle, players found an exploit that allowed them to avoid combat almost entirely. The project wasn't a complete loss however,
as I recived a first on my overall paper thanks to my analysis.

### What did I learn?
- Planning: Throughout the project, my planning often felt dubious at best. In future,  I need to set solid but reasonable deadlines
to ensure I keep on track. 
- Playtest: When making a game, don't wait to playtest. Test things as frequently as you can with other people. <br>
- Scope Creep: When making games start small and work up from a solid base. If I realised I didn't have as much time as I thought,
I probably wouldn't have gone about designing the game the way I did. E.g Set levels instead of randomised or simpler combat.
