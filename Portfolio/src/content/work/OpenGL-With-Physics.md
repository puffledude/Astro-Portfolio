### What I did

This project was my second adventure and coursework into OpenGL. The goal this time
gain an understanding of the physics that underline video games and their calculations. I also aimed
to get a better understanding of character AI and how behaviour can be programmed using state machines.
To do this, I worked from a given bare bones Open-GL engine and implemented the required functionality to make
a game. I also went beyond the required specifications to test my skills. This included doing:
- Scripting a level exporter so I could create levels quickly for my game.
- Implementing custom materials so I could clearly highlight dangers to the player.
- Implementing a string-pulling algorithm for smooth AI character navigation.
