## My first true foray into the Unity Game Engine

### Why was this made?

This project started life as a personal attempt to learn Unity and gain a foothold in understanding game development. To make sure I finished the project, 
I ended up submitting it as a piece of coursework in my third year. <br>
For the themeing, at the time I was feeling nostalgic for my time playing Team Fortress 2 in years prior,
especaily the rocket jumping tutorial maps. As a result, I wanted to have a go at designing something similar.

### What is the game about?
The game is a 3D platformer.
