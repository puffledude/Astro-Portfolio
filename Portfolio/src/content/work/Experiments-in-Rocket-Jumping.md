## My first true foray into the Unity Game Engine

### Why was this made?

This project started life as a personal attempt to learn Unity and gain a foothold in understanding game development. To make sure I finished the project, 
I ended up submitting it as a piece of coursework in my third year. <br>
For the themeing, at the time I was feeling nostalgic for my time playing Team Fortress 2 in years prior,
especaily the rocket jumping tutorial maps. As a result, I wanted to have a go at designing something similar.

### What is the game about?
The game is a 3D platformer, where the player must traverse portal style rooms to reach a goal at the end of the level. Whilst the players general movement is limited, 
they are given a Rocket Launcher. By performing TF2 style rocket jumps, the player is able to use the explosions to propel themselves around the level. Levels are also
timed for those who wish to compare times and compete with each other.

### What did I learn?
Primarily, this project was to gain a strong foundation in my games programming knowledge. This I succeeded in. In learning Unity essentially from scratch, I had to piece
together a large amount of basic concepts of games programming (such as raycasting) from scratch. Further more, the game ran without any noticeable major bugs. However, there ended up being
some major problems with my design upon submission. Firstly, the rocket jump was hard to time so chaining jumps together wasn't always very seemless as I envsioned. Secondly, I also made some levels far
larger than they needed to be. My takeaway from this was to focus on quality over quantity where ever possible.
