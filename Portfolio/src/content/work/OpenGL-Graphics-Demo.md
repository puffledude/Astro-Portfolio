## Experimenting with OpenGL:

### What I did?
This project was my first introduction into using OpenGL. 
After an inital set of tutorials by our lecturers, we were let free to experiment for coursework.
 I decided on making island scene to keep myself constrained in terms of scale 
and have to ensure I thought carefully on where I placed decorations. Of the inital effects we were given,
I implemented:
- Deferred Rendering
- Real Time Shadows
- Cubemapped reflections
- A skybox

### How I expanded on this base?
Whilst I had a solid foundation, I wanted to make this project my own. To do this, I
explored multiple other effects. This included FXAA, instanced rendering (fire particles) and 
later SSAO. These all worked to add depth and show off my island scene.

### What did I learn?

OpenGL had been somewhat of a mystery to me up until this point. I knew of it from my PC gaming over the years,
but I only had a vague idea of how it worked. The lessons I have gained from writing my own shaders and gpu code
will be useful for the rest of my career in games.
