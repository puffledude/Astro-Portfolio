### What I did

This project was my second adventure and coursework into OpenGL. The goal this time
gain an understanding of the core systems that make up modern video games (physics, state machines, networking).
To do this, I worked from a given bare bones Open-GL engine and implemented many different features such as:
- Collisions
- Multiplayer
- UI
- A state machine for enemy AI

### How I expanded on the given base:
I also went beyond the required specifications to test my skills. This included doing:
- Scripting a level exporter so I could create levels quickly for my game.
- Implementing custom materials so I could clearly highlight dangers to the player.
- Implementing a string-pulling algorithm for smooth AI character navigation.

Whilst these challenged me, they also improved my score on the coursework significantly (85/100)

### What did I learn:
Up until this point, I had only a vague understanding of how all these systems came together. In engines such as Unity,
physics is provided as standard. Similarly, pathfinding is something that I took for granted from working in Unity.
By implementing them myself I've found a new understanding of how these basic systems come together and function
so people can make games.
